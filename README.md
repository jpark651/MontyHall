# Monty Hall

This program demonstrates the Monty Hall problem. The user can select from 3 doors, with only one of the doors being correct. After choosing a door, an incorrect door is revealed and the user is given the chance to switch the door they selected.

A page of statistics keeps track of how many games the user wins/loses when switching/keeping their initial door selection.

Note: Switching to the remaining door is the best option, as it inverts the odds of success (the 1/3 chance of winning becomes a 2/3 chance of winning). This is true for any number of doors: If 1 door is selected randomly from a set of 1 million doors, and then 999998 incorrect doors are revealed, switching to the remaining door changes the 1/1000000 chance of winning to a 999999/1000000 chance of winning. This assumes the same number of incorrect doors will be revealed no matter which door is initially selected.
